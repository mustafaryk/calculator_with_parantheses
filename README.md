# calculator_with_parantheses
A functioning calculator with functionality for parantheses. Input is entered exactly as it would be on a real calculator. Decimal numbers can also be inputted. For exponents, a^b, for multiplication a*b, for division a/b, for addition a+b, for subtraction a-b, Example of a valid equation would be without quotes "((4-3-2)^2+3-6)-(7+8)^0.5". 
NO FAILSAFE MEASURES, wrong or incoherent inputs will lead to the code breaking. 3+-3 is wrong. 3-3 is correct
Nested brackets are supported eg (4(3-6))
Seperated brackets are supported eg (4+3)(4+6)^2
Takes BODMAS into account
Square root of negative numbers breaks the code
